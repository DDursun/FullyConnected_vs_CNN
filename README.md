# FullyConnected_vs_CNN


This repository presents a comparative analysis of Fully Connected Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. It highlights the differences in architecture, functionality, and performance between these two foundational neural network designs.

The project was developed as part of the Machine Learning (CSCI 6364) course at George Washington University, instructed by Professor Blake Woodworth. It serves as a practical exploration of neural network principles and their applications.
