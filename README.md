# FullyConnected_vs_CNN

## Overview

This repository presents a comparative analysis of Fully Connected Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. It highlights the differences in architecture, functionality, and performance between these two foundational neural network designs using MNIST digits dataset.

The project was developed as part of the Machine Learning (CSCI 6364) course at George Washington University, instructed by Professor Blake Woodworth. It serves as a practical exploration of neural network principles and their applications.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (install instructions below).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FullyConnected_vs_CNN.git
   cd FullyConnected_vs_CNN
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script to train and evaluate the Fully Connected Network:
   ```bash
   python hw3.py
   ```

3. View the outputs in the terminal or generated plots for further analysis.

## Output
